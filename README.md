## üìä Project Overview: Optimization of Machine Downtime  

### üéØ Project Objective  
The goal was to analyze and minimize machine downtime by predicting failures and identifying downtime trends. This involved:  
1. Leveraging **MySQL** for business moment analysis.  
2. Utilizing **Python** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and building a machine learning model.  
3. Creating **Power BI dashboards** to visualize trends and aid in data-driven decisions.

## üóÇ Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Extraction and Business Moment Analysis (MySQL)**  
- Retrieved raw downtime data from databases.  
- Designed optimized queries to understand downtime scenarios and initial trends.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python)**  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed gaps in data.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Used statistical methods to remove anomalies.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to improve predictive modeling.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Predictive Modeling (Python)**  
- Built a machine learning model using **Scikit-learn** to predict machine failures.  
- Achieved **98% accuracy** (to be finalized with testing).  
- Validated the model using **cross-validation** to ensure robustness.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Interactive Dashboards (Power BI)**  
- Created **dynamic dashboards** to analyze trends and visualize metrics like:  
  - Downtime count by month and day of the week.  
  - Average hydraulic pressure, torque, and cutting force trends.  
  - Overall downtime trends over time.  
- Enabled actionable insights to assist decision-makers.

## üìä Insights from Power BI Dashboards  

### **1. Count of Downtime by Month**  
**Question:** How does the count of machine downtimes vary across months?  
**Insights:**  
- March recorded the highest downtime (**498 instances**).  
- June (**2 instances**) and December (**13 instances**) had the lowest downtimes.  
- Sharp increase from January to March signals operational issues.  
- Downtime increased from January to March, indicating operational issues.

---

### **2. Count of Downtime by Day of the Week**  
**Question:**  Which days of the week experience the most downtime?  
**Insights:**  
- Wednesday showed the highest downtime (**182 instances**), followed by Tuesday (**179 instances**).  
- Sunday had the least downtime (**160 instances**).  
- Midweek peaks might indicate heavy workloads or maintenance schedules.
- Downtimes were consistent from Thursday to Sunday with minimal variation.
  
---

### **3. Average Hydraulic Pressure & Torque by Time Period**  
**Question:** How do hydraulic pressure and torque vary over time?  
**Insights:**  
- Peaks in **March and May 2022**.  
- Hydraulic pressure fluctuated more than torque, indicating potential inefficiencies.  
- Torque showed stability, while hydraulic pressure fluctuated significantly.
- Pressure spikes may reflect high-demand operations or external factors.
  
---

### **4. Average Cutting Force (kN) by Time Period**  
**Question:** What trends are observed in cutting force over time?  
**Insights:**  
- Steady increase from January to March, peaking in **March and May**.  
- Gradual decline toward June reflects reduced workloads.  
- Cutting force increased steadily from **January to March 2022.**
- The upward trend early in the year may indicate seasonal demand surges.
  
---

### **5. Downtime Count by Time Period**  
**Question:**  What is the trend in machine downtimes over time?  
**Insights:**  
- Downtime peaked in March and steadily decreased after intervention.  
- June recorded the lowest downtimes, suggesting improved processes.  
- The March spike highlights maintenance issues or bottlenecks.
  
---

## üìö Key Learnings and Skills Acquired  
- **MySQL**: Writing complex queries to extract and analyze business data.  
- **Python**: Advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning.  
- **Power BI**: Designing interactive dashboards to convey insights effectively.  
- **Problem-Solving**: Translating raw data into actionable strategies.
