## ðŸ“Š Project Overview: Optimization of Machine Downtime ðŸ“Š  

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Description  
The objective of this project was to analyze and minimize machine downtime by predicting machine failure and identifying downtime trends. This involved:  
- Extracting business insights through SQL.  
- Cleaning and transforming data using Python.  
- Developing a basic machine learning model to predict potential machine failures.  
- Creating interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize downtime trends and support decision-making.  

### ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights  
1. **SQL for Business Moment Analysis**:  
   - Retrieved initial business moment information for understanding downtime scenarios.  
   - Designed optimized queries for data extraction.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed raw data using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy).  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.  

3. **Machine Learning for Failure Prediction**:  
   - Built a basic machine learning model using Scikit-learn.  
   - Achieved 98 % accuracy (to be updated with final results).  
   - Conducted feature engineering to improve model performance.  

4. **Power BI Dashboards**:  
   - Developed dynamic dashboards to analyze downtime trends over time.  
   - Included visualizations such as line charts and bar graphs to support operational decisions.
